# Deployment (Canary, A/B-Deployment, Blue-/Green-Deployment) 

## Canary Deployment 

```
A small group of the user base will see the new application 
(e.g. 1000 out of 100.000), all the others will still see the old version

From: a canary was used to test if the air was good in the mine 
(like a test balloon) 
```

## Blue / Green Deployment 

```
The current version is the Blue one 
The new version is the Green one 

New Version (GREEN) will be tested and if it works  
the traffic will be switch completey to the new version (GREEN) 

Old version can either be deleted or will function as fallback 
```

## A/B Deployment/Testing 

```
2 Different versions are online, e.g. to test a new design / new feature 
You can configure the weight (how much traffic to one or the other) 
by the number of pods
```

### Example Calculation 

```
e.g. Deployment1: 10 pods
Deployment2: 5 pods

Both have a common label,
The service will access them through this label 
```
